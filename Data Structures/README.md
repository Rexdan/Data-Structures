# Project Title

This repository will host a variety of Data Structures to be used for practice.
You know the saying, if you don't use it, you lose it.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

These projects will require, at the very least, JDK 7.
Check for Java version in your environment.

```
java --version
```

* [If you need to install Java.](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

### Installing


```
javac <all_java_files>
```

## Testing

To run the driver for one of the packages, e.g. graphs:

```
java Driver
```

NOTE: The driver class will need to be edited to apply any testing that you may want to do.
